The AI engineer's work primarily involved feature implementation and bug fixes across the React frontend and FastAPI backend. Key developments included: refining the fleet gallery and handling image additions/removals; integrating and configuring Stripe payments; creating an Admin Dashboard for booking management with email/WhatsApp notifications; implementing a delayed review reminder system; correcting timezone handling for bookings; and adding an authentication system for the admin panel. Additionally, the engineer corrected the website URL and, most recently, implemented a new dark-themed service areas section. The current task involves removing an old service areas section, which hit a tool error. The work shows an iterative process, responding to specific user feedback and debugging rendering or logic issues.

<product_requirements>
The project aims to create a professional, responsive, and German-localized taxi service website (Taxi Türlihof) for specific Swiss regions, using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB within a WordPress theme. Core features include a Google Maps API-driven Price Calculator and Online Booking System, a Fleet Gallery, and robust SEO. Recent development focused on payment system integration (Stripe configured), a functional Admin Dashboard for booking management (view, update status), automated email/WhatsApp customer notifications upon booking confirmation and ride completion (including review reminders), correct European/Swiss timezone handling for bookings, and secure admin panel access via login. The latest UI updates involve integrating a new dark-themed Servicegebiete (Service Areas) section with clickable links.
