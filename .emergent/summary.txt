The AI engineer effectively managed the Taxi Türlihof project, evolving it from a feature-rich React application to a WordPress theme. Key tasks included refining the service areas section by adjusting text placement and adding map links, implementing extensive SEO improvements such as creating dedicated landing pages, integrating an FAQ section, a blog, and technical SEO elements. The engineer also addressed several UI adjustments for clarity and user experience, like re-adding missing fleet images and simplifying the homepage layout based on explicit user feedback. The final major pivot was to convert the entire React application into a functional WordPress theme, demonstrating significant adaptability and technical range. Challenges included fixing JSX syntax errors and ensuring all previous features were retained during redesigns and the conversion process.

The Taxi Türlihof project aimed to create a professional, responsive German website for a taxi service in Luzern, Schwyz, and Zug. Core requirements included displaying company branding, a detailed service overview, transparent pricing, coverage areas, payment methods, and a fleet gallery. Key interactive features were a contact form, a precise price calculator using Google Maps API, and an online booking system with email confirmations. SEO was a major focus, encompassing meta tags, structured data, and local targeting.
Implementation so far has delivered a full-stack React application with a FastAPI backend and MongoDB, fulfilling initial feature sets. Subsequent updates involved refining the Servicegebiete section with localized text and map links, comprehensive SEO enhancements including city-specific landing pages, an FAQ section, a blog, and technical SEO. The design was iteratively simplified, ensuring all features remained while creating a more compact and user-friendly homepage, prominently displaying fleet images and a detailed price list. The most recent and ongoing product requirement is to convert this entire functionality into a deployable WordPress theme, ensuring ease of management for the user.
